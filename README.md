# How Microsoft might of viewed the 90s Video Game market
This analysis explores the videogame industry in the 90s. Specifically from the point of view of Microsoft and the possibility of them joining the console market. I will break down the data step by step and show what specific steps Microsoft could take to maximize their first entry into the Home Console Wars.

## Deciding Where to Start
If we sort Global sales by year we can see that the last four years of the 90s is the bulk of individual game sales. So we will be focusing from 1996-1999


When it comes to Platforms, Nintento and Playstation have a massive lead over PC. Thus we will exclude PC Sales from this analysis.


For Global Sales, North America takes up about half the market. To stay with what Microsoft knows best, we will only be analyzing North America Sales. We also notice that Playstation has a much larger market share than Nintento.


## Digging Deeper

With a quick look at the top sales for each platform, it seems like Nintendo outshines Playstation in best selling games. But those sales fall a bit sharper than Playstations which stay steady above Three Million per game. We should look further into top games by year to see if we can spot a trend.


Looking at Nintendo first, we see the steep decline in sales for their top games carry over year to year. With 1999 being a bit more consistant. Possibly because of the maturity of the Video Game market. Or maybe just some overall great games.


Playstations top sales are much more consistant. Even year over year there isnt much change. which could debunk the maturing market idea. It seems the same people are coming back to the same systems. We should look into the top selling genres for each platform to try to get a better understanding of why.

Breaking down the genre sales it becomes much more obvious why Playstation is winning in sales.
Playstations top three genres, Action, Sports, and Racing are almost equal. Nintndos top seller, Racing, is around half of Playstations Racing sales. But Nintendo still has the top four selling games. Again we should dig a littel deeper to try to understand what hold Nintendo has on the market.


Yearly sales for Nintendo when it comes to genre are a bit sparse. It seems like Nintendo has hits that pull in large numbers of sales. But Nintendo is not able to keep those players around for other games linke playstation is. Playstaion on the other had is growing in almost every catagory.
